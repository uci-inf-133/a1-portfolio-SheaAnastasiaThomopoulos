      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science student specializing in Intelligent Systems at UC Irvine. Alongside Dr. Stacy Branham, I conduct research in accessible technology, focusing on helping low-vision and blind high school students transition into college STEM degrees. Growing up, my family and I moved around a lot; I attended elementary school in Texas, middle school in Italy, and high school in Switzerland. So it only felt natural to move once again for university, which is how I ended up in Irvine, California.</p>

      <p>At UCI, I discovered my passion for accessibility and inclusive technology. Growing up with dyslexia meant I often relied on different assistive tools to support my education, which gave me firsthand experience with the impact of accessible design. It wasn't until later that I realized the industry behind these tools often falls under Computer Science. I found myself drawn more toward user experience and design-oriented courses than traditional CS ones and that's what sparked my interest in pursuing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for my master's degree.</p>
